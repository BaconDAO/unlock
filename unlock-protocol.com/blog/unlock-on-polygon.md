Unlock has been deployed to Polygon! As Ethereum's main net is increasingly crowded, we wanted to give the ability to creators to deploy their locks and memberships on other networks, such as [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/).

Polygon is an EVM-compatible blockchain which runs of proof-of-stake and offers much cheaper transaction costs. It currently costs about $0.0003 to purchase a membership on a lock deployed on Polygon (another way to look at this is that it would require you to purchase about 33 different memberships to spend 1ct in fees!)

Our goal for Unlock is to be available on _every_ EVM compatible environment, with a **core** on the mainnet, where governance and UDT minting happens.

## Getting started

Once your wallet is configured for Polygon, [head over to your dashboard](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/dashboard) to deploy your first lock. Like always you can set your own price, duration and maximum number of members! You can also use any ERC20 like you would do on Ethereum's mainnet. You can also enable credit card payments on these locks for users who do not have a crypto wallet or do not have Matic tokens in their wallets.

## Earning UDT on Polygon

We want Unlock to belong to its users.
