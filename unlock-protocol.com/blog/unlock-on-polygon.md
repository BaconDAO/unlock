Unlock has been deployed to Polygon! As Ethereum's main net is increasingly crowded, we wanted to give the ability to creators to deploy their locks and memberships on other networks, such as [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/).

Polygon is an EVM-compatible blockchain which runs of proof-of-stake and offers much cheaper transaction costs. It currently costs about $0.0003 to purchase a membership on a lock deployed on Polygon (another way to look at this is that it would require you to purchase about 33 different memberships to spend 1ct in fees!)
